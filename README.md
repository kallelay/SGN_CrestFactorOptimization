# Crest Factor Optimization for Multisine Signals

## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of the "Deblur" algorithm for crest factor optimization of multisine signals. The algorithm combines sigmoid transform and Gauss-Newton optimization to minimize the crest factor, resulting in more efficient use of the signal's dynamic range.

## Implementations

The algorithm is available in multiple languages/formats:

1. MATLAB: `MATLAB/deblur_main.m`
2. Python: `Python/deblur_main.py`
3. Python Flask (SAAS): `Python-Flask/deblur_main_web.py`
4. HTML/JavaScript: `HTML_Javascript/deblur_main.html`

You only need to download and use one version, depending on your preferred language or environment.

## Online Demo

You can test the algorithm online at: [https://kallelay.com/deblur/deblur_main.html](https://kallelay.com/deblur/deblur_main.html)

Please note that the online version is relatively slow compared to the MATLAB and Python implementations due to the limitations of browser-based execution.
